- 👋 Hi, I’m @uxeric
- 💞️ I’m interested in everything javascript, machine learning, and Web 3/2.5
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on fun Vue or React projects that leverage LLMs

## Whatcha' thinkin'?
- [MOJO](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/basics) is exciting, and has the potential of being a truly general purpose language. [Chris Lattner](https://github.com/lattner) is a hero.
- Rust is fun, but the skill issues it imposes on new devs limits it's growth potential.
- Getting the impression that LLM technology has stabilized somewhat, which means it's time for us devs who don't have immense amounts of VC money to burn to actually build stuff with it. Exciting times!
- Is HTMX + Go the way to go for a significant portion of web projects?
- Are we on the path to Web 3 yet? Could [Web 2.5](https://github.com/socketsupply) be the route that leads us there?
- Is the BBQ the only cooking appliance we need? Should all recipes conform to it's particular constraints or just most?
