- 👋 Hi, I’m @uxeric
- 💞️ I’m interested in everything javascript, machine learning, and Web 3/2.5
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on fun Vue or React projects that leverage LLMs

## What's on my mind
- The cool kids were right about Tailwind
- Will we outright remove the first few rungs of the development ladder with projects like GPT-Engineer and SMOL Developer?
- Do projects like Svelte and Astro have staying power? Or will their effect be to influcence the React and Nuxt ecosystems and then fade away.
- Are we on the path to Web 3? Could [Web 2.5](https://github.com/socketsupply) be the route that leads us there?
- Is the BBQ the only cooking applicance we need? Should all recipes conform to it's particular constraints or just most?
