- 👋 Hi, I’m @uxeric
- 💞️ I’m interested in everything Javascript
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on fun Vue or React projects

## What's on my mind
- The cool kids were right about Tailwind
- We're currently in a contraction period where we're evaluating the multiplicy of tools required to push out a project. I wonder what the JS ecosystem will look like after this period.
- Do projects like Svelte and Astro have staying power? Or will their effect be to influcence the React and Nuxt ecosystems and then fade away.
- Is the BBQ the only cooking applicance we need? Should all recipes conform to it's particular constraints or just most?
