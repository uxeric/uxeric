## Profile
- 👋 Hi, I’m @uxeric
- 💞️ I’m interested in everything javascript, machine learning, and Web 3/2.5
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on fun Vue or React projects that leverage LLMs

## What's on my mind
- Rust is a beautifully structured functional language that's truly pleasant to code with, and not that complicated to use (not for web dev projects anyway).
- Is HTMX + Go (or Rust?) the way for a lot of web projects?
- Will AI kill developer jobs, or will it supercharge developers making custom software actually affordable?
- Do projects like Svelte and Astro have staying power? Or will their effect be to influence the React and Nuxt ecosystems and then fade away.
- Are we on the path to Web 3? Could [Web 2.5](https://github.com/socketsupply) be the route that leads us there?
- Is the BBQ the only cooking appliance we need? Should all recipes conform to it's particular constraints or just most?
